\c Put this code in main.txt to see what it does!
\c declaring an integer variable called x
new int x
\c declaring a string variable called y
new string y
\c assigning the integer 1 to x
var x = 1
\c assigning the string 'hello' to y
var y = hello
\c print 'Enter something: ' to the screen
out raw Enter something:
\c taking the user's input and assigning it to the string variable y
in var y
out raw This is what you entered:
\c prints what is stored in the string var y to the screen
out var y
\c creates a loop called 'theLoop' that loops 5 times
loop theLoop 5
\c adds 1 to the integer variable x
math var x = var x + raw 1
\c creates an if statement called 'theIf' that sees whether the integer variable x is equal to the raw integer 5
if theIf ( var x ) == ( raw 5 )
out raw The value of x is 5!
\c signals the end of the scope of the if block
endif theIf
\c signals the end of the scope of the loop block
endloop theLoop
out raw This is the end of the sample program.
